# 🌐 Luca Fraticola - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio website!  
This site showcases who I am, what I do, and how you can get in touch with me.

## 🔍 About the Project

This is a responsive and modern portfolio built with:

- **HTML5** for structure  
- **SCSS** compiled to **CSS** for styling  
- **JavaScript** for interactivity  
- **Bootstrap Icons** for visuals  
- **EmailJS** (planned or active) for contact form integration

📍 Coordinates featured on the homepage:
> N 44°47'04.2"  
> E 9°19'01.2"  
A personal nod to the Oltrepò Pavese and Mount Penice, my home roots in Italy 🇮🇹

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you want to run this locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have **Live Server** and **Live Sass Compiler** extensions in VS Code
3. Use `main.scss` as your entry point and compile to `/assets/css/main.css`
4. Launch `Live Server` from `about.html` or any page

Make sure `settings.json` is correctly set up to point Sass output to `assets/css`.
