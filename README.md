This is a responsive and modern portfolio built with:

- **HTML5** for structure

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you want to run this locally:

1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure you have **Live Server** and **Live Sass Compiler** extensions in VS Code
3. Use `main.scss` as your entry point and compile to `/assets/css/main.css`
4. Launch `Live Server` from `about.html` or any page

Make sure `settings.json` is correctly set up to point Sass output to `assets/css`.
